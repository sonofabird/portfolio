    problemDescription1: "Starting a business is hard! It’s difficult to know where to start, what you need,  and whether or not your idea is any good.  Even once you have a business plan in place, how can you be sure it is ready to present to investors?",
    problemDescription2: "Unfortunately, it’s not always possible to check in with experts and investors at every step of the way- their time is valuable!  Furthermore, if you present an incomplete or unrefined plan, it may be difficult for them to understand your goals and offer the help you need."
